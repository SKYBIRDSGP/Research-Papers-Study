# A * Algorithm 

To define it in simple words, A* is a **search algorithm** that has long been used in the **pathfinding activities**. Its efficiency, simplicity, and modularity are often highlighted as its strengths compared to other tools, yet it encounters many hurdles, and thus is not a full proof algorithm, yet one of the best and widely used.   

The algorithm not only needs to consider the optimal path for each agent individually but also take into account the interactions and potential conflicts between them. Resolving these conflicts and finding a harmonious solution where all agents can reach their destinations efficiently becomes a significant challenge for the A* algorithm in such scenarios.

### Modifications in the Heuristic

Heuristic functions guide algorithms by offering approximate solutions based on available information, aiming for efficiency over optimality in decision-making.    
One of the common heuristic functions in pathfinding is heuristic distance. There are a couple of heuristic distances 
such as the Manhattan distance, excluding distance, and diagonal distance.
